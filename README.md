## Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation is a typical strategy used by organisations to categorise clients based on their demographics, shopping patterns, or other traits.

## Dataset:
Look for a dataset that contains information about customers such as demographic information, purchasing history, and customer interactions. If you are looking for sample dataset, then download this Online Retail Dataset which contains the following variables:

InvoiceNo: The invoice number for each transaction

StockCode: The unique code for each product sold

Description: The description of each product sold

Quantity: The quantity of each product sold in each transaction

InvoiceDate: The date and time of each transaction

UnitPrice: The price of each product sold

CustomerID: The unique identifier for each customer

Country: The country where each transaction occurred

## SQL Project Questions: 

Use SQL queries to answer the following questions:

-What is the distribution of order values across all customers in the dataset?

-How many unique products has each customer purchased?

-number of unique products
-numbers of customers

-Which customers have only made a single purchase from the company?
-Which products are most commonly purchased together by customers in the dataset?
-What is the total revenue generated from all transactions?
-count of country
-Which customers have generated the highest revenue?
-Which products are most popular in each country?
-How many customers made repeat purchases?
-Which products have been sold the most in terms of quantity?
